# julia with vs code

1. install julia, set environment variable (if you have set environment variable, vs code can find julia automatically)

2. from vs code, add julia extension

3. setting: if code couldn't find julia's execution path, set it

NB: even if in windows os, instead of backslash (\), use slash (/) or double backslash (\\) as folder separator

4. use julia in vs code: open a file, save with extension .jl

The .jl file extension indicates to VS Code that you interpret this file as a Julia program, therefore 
it evaluates the contents with the Julia extension and the selected interpreter
